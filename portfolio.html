<h2> Statistics <sup><a href="http://ww5.komen.org/BreastCancer/Statistics.html">1</a></sup></h2>
<p>In 2015, in the US (among women) it is estimated that there will be:</p>
<ul>
  <li>231,840 new cases of invasive breast cancer</li>
  <li>40,290 breast cancer deaths</li>
</ul>



<p><h2> My Story </h2></p>
<p>A few months ago I was genetically tested for the braca1 and braca2 genes, the genes that are linked to breast cancer.</p>
<p>My results came back negative, meaning that my genes are not mutated allowing my chances of getting breast cancer to go down.</p>
