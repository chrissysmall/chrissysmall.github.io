My name is Chrissy Small. I am a junior at Saint Joseph's University double majoring in Communications and Political Science.
I am currently interning at the Susan G. Komen affiliate: Komen Philadelphia.
I am the events intern under the supervision of events coordinator, Amanda Sweet, and the assistant to the CEO, Kathy McGarvey.
I am receiving credit for the fall but in the spring I will be interning without credit or pay.
As the events intern I have been apart of the Pink Tide Ball 2015 fundraising event and Grillebration 2015 that was with the School District of Philadelphia.
I am now working on the events: Strength & Survival with Philly POPs, The Race Pep Rally, and the Race for the Cure.
I also help with the social media coordinator in order to plan out media postings and gain a following base.
